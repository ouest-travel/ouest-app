## Purpose
This should be used for tasks that involve redux state, actions, and logic

**State Slices Pattern**:
- `auth`: User authentication and session management
- `network`: Blockchain network selection and configuration
- `trade`: Trading interface state and selected tokens
- `tokens`: Token data and market information
- `settings`: User preferences and application settings


### Persistence Strategy
- **SSR Critical Data**: Stored in cookies for server-side access
- **Client-side Data**: Stored in IndexedDB for performance
- **Mobile**: AsyncStorage with Redux Persist integration
