The user object is stored in the authStore. We should primariliry access user details like so

```
import { useUser } from `@/stores/zustand/authStore`
const user = useUser()
```

Note that there is also a `useUser` hook from `@privy-io/react-auth`. We should avoid using the user from this hook since it can't distinctivily provide the embeded wallet address for the user.
