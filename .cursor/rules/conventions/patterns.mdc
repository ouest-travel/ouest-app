Look for existing patterns and follow them. When adding new UI, study nearby implementations before introducing new structures.

### Modal Pattern

- Render lightweight modal triggers in feature components.
- Render the modal components themselves in the existing modal host for that feature (e.g. `Navbar/index.tsx` for top-level modals).
- Only add new modal mounts elsewhere if a clear, documented exception exists.
- Always test to avoid bugs as much as possible
